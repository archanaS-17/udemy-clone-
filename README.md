Udemy Clone â€“ EMC Journey Week 1 Task

This project is a simple Udemy clone webpage created using HTML and CSS as part of my EMC Journey - Week 1 Task. Through this project, I explored and applied several core CSS concepts such as:

* Flexbox layout
* Box model
* Display properties
* Hover effects
* Justify-content

This hands-on experience helped me strengthen the foundational skills essential for front-end development and served as a strong step toward building my career with confidence and clarity.
